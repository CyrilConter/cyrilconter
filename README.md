## Hi there, I am Cyril ðŸ‘‹
* I am currently working full-time as a consultant at [Agile Partner](https://www.agilepartner.net) in Luxembourg.
* According our customer needs, I act sometimes as software developer, as business analyst or as project manager.
* I love technical & business challenges.
* I discovered programming with my brother's [Amstrad CPC 464](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC) (with green screen) and I was fascinated by the possibility to display content using few lines of [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) code.
